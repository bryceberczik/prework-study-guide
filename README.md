# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason I built this web application is because as a bootcamp student, I am going to need a great study guide to help me along the way. Knowing that I would have a proper guide that can help me with the basics going forward gave me enough motivation to properly execute this site to life.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to review notes from all the material covered in the prework of the bootcamp. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
